- `apps/desktop/src-tauri/src/runtime.rs`: Runtime management remains a large central orchestrator.
- `apps/desktop/src-tauri/src/skills.rs`: Skill discovery, metadata parsing, provider-specific projection, install, uninstall, and curated metadata handling remain bundled in one backend module.
- `apps/desktop/src-tauri/src/telegram/mod.rs`: Telegram bot integration is currently a large monolith and needs phased extraction.
- `apps/desktop/src-tauri/src/terminal.rs`: Terminal management and adapter logic is still bundled together.
- `apps/desktop/src-tauri/src/tmux.rs`: tmux launch, status parsing, and recovery helpers are still bundled together.

- `apps/desktop/src/components/workspace/WorkspaceNativeSessionView.tsx`: Native workspace transcript, attention handling, and composer orchestration remain concentrated during the workspace redesign.
- `apps/desktop/src/pages/CronTasks.tsx`: Cron task list, run timeline, and editor orchestration are still centralized during the scheduler surface redesign.
